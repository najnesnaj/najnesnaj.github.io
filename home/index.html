<p>The informed investor is just a pretext to boost my skillset.
I have been impressed with the functionality of pandas, python &mldr;</p>
<p>I have attended a free course on EDX, but nothing beats practice.</p>
<p>Investing is a very human topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can try AI, quantative analysis, trend analysis &mldr;</li>
<li>Still, you have to be knowledgebleable on macroeconomics, human psychology, politics, geopolitics &mldr;</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting informed is another obstacle.
<em>Most financial data is not free.</em></p>
<p>What the ancient Greeks used to say : &ldquo;gnothi seauton&rdquo; (know thyselve) is important too.
I&rsquo;m not really Warren Buffet, and beating the market is not my aim.
These days it will be a challenge to stay ahead of inflation &mldr;</p>
<p>I cannot time the market, but I can try to get an idea about risk (by being informed):</p>
<ul>
<li>is the EM country more than 60% in debt</li>
<li>what about Foreign Direct Investment</li>
<li>is stock exchange on par with GDP</li>
<li>how long is the upward trend in effect</li>
<li>&mldr;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investing in stocks is risky, you can end up losing 50 percent or more</strong></p>
