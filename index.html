<h1 id=the-pleasure-bucket>The pleasure bucket</h1>
<p>I read a book on portfolio management. They allocated capital to investment &ldquo;buckets&rdquo;.
A good advise was also to keep something in the <strong>pleasure</strong> bucket.</p>
<p>All the projects I put on github, although not material, are part of this &ldquo;bucket&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I really get a buzz in trying to figure something out.</p>
<h2 id=_ive-taken-an-interest-in-investing_><em>I&rsquo;ve taken an interest in investing</em></h2>
<p><strong>Investing</strong> got my attention while working with STM and Nordic microntrollers:</p>
<p>While working on opensource projects, I noticed that the shares of STM and Nordic soured.
So had I just bought a few shares of the hardware (which I knew well, and appreciated), other &ldquo;buckets&rdquo; would have been filled. :-)</p>
<p>My main project can be found under this repository:</p>
<p><a href=https://github.com/najnesnaj/deden-invest>portfolio</a></p>
<p>this project should :</p>
<ul>
<li>notice investment opportunities (buy)</li>
<li>protect a portfolio (sell)</li>
</ul>
<p>In most countries big investers and insiders have to file their positions.
Most of this data is public for consultation, so some webscraping is needed.</p>
<p>You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., <a href=/post/>posts</a>, or <a href=/note/>notes</a>.
See the <a href=/about/>About</a> page for some human information.</p>
