title: The Informed Investor

The informed investor is just a pretext to boost my skillset.
I have been impressed with the functionality of pandas, python ...

I have attended a free course on EDX, but nothing beats practice.

Investing is a very human topic:

- You can try AI, quantative analysis, trend analysis ...
- Still, you have to be knowledgebleable on macroeconomics, human psychology, politics, geopolitics ...

Getting informed is another obstacle.
*Most financial data is not free.*


What the ancient Greeks used to say : "gnothi seauton" (know thyselve) is important too.
I'm not really Warren Buffet, and beating the market is not my aim.
These days it will be a challenge to stay ahead of inflation ...



I cannot time the market, but I can try to get an idea about risk (by being informed):
- is the EM country more than 60% in debt
- what about Foreign Direct Investment
- is stock exchange on par with GDP
- how long is the upward trend in effect
- ....


**Investing in stocks is risky, you can end up losing 50 percent or more**
