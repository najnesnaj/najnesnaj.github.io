## _I've taken an interest in investing_

**Investing** got my intention while working with STM and Nordic microntrollers:

While working on opensource projects, I noticed that the shares of STM and Nordic soured. So had I just bought a few shares of the hardware (which I knew well, and appreciated), I could have gotten a return of 300%!

I'm in the process of documenting everything in an automated fashion.
I equally apply this to my investing repository, but here the endresult should be an intelligence report, to assist in taking wise investment decisions.

```bash
in the latest repositories I have included a command to generate documentation/financial reporting

./gendoc
```

```
	Apart from the tech-stuff, I did quite a bit of reading on investing. I have a focus on resource rich emerging markets, precious metals and value investing.
	Best book I read on investing : **Tomorrow's gold by dr Marc Faber**.
