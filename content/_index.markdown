# The pleasure bucket

I read a book on portfolio management. They allocated capital to investment "buckets". 
A good advise was also to keep something in the **pleasure** bucket.
 
All the projects I put on github, although not material, are part of this "bucket".

I really get a buzz in trying to figure something out.

## _I've taken an interest in investing_

**Investing** got my attention while working with STM and Nordic microntrollers:

While working on opensource projects, I noticed that the shares of STM and Nordic soured. 
So had I just bought a few shares of the hardware (which I knew well, and appreciated), other "buckets" would have been filled. :-)



My main project can be found under this repository:

 [portfolio](https://github.com/najnesnaj/deden-invest) 

this project should : 
-	notice investment opportunities (buy)
-	protect a portfolio (sell)

In most countries big investers and insiders have to file their positions.
Most of this data is public for consultation, so some webscraping is needed.
