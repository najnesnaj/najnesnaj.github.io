## projects

I've done quite a few projects, mostly to educate myself.

## techie

I noticed while working with a Nordic microcontroller (and noticing how sophisticated they are) that the value of the company on the stock exchange exploded.

Actually same thing happened to me fiddling with STM hardware.

## noticed

geeking out on tech stuff is OK, but why not make a buck in the process?

## investing
